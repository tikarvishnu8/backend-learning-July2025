# Day 1-GitHub and JS Basics

1. Printing to Console
Used console.log() to print messages and variables.

2. Variables and Data Types

var: Can be re-declared and updated (global scope).

let: Can be updated, but not re-declared (block scope).

const: Cannot be updated or re-declared (block scope).

Primitive Data Types:Number, Null, Boolean, BigInt, String, Symbol, Undefined

Non-Primitive Data Types:

Objects (key-value pairs)

Arrays, Functions (subcategories of objects)

3. typeof Operator
Used to check the type of a variable (e.g., typeof fullName returns "string").

Examples You Used
Defined variables like fullName, age, price, x, and y.

Used an object fullDetails with properties like name, age, cgpa, and degree.

Updated the value of age inside the object using:

Summary Statement:
learned how to declare and use variables in JavaScript, the differences between var, let, and const, understood primitive vs. non-primitive data types, worked with objects, and practiced accessing and updating object values.


Welcome to Day 2 Lerning JS.
 in day 2 we I learn.

 In day 2 we learn how the conditional statements, alart, prompt are working.

Check if a number is a multiple of 5 using if-else and % operator.(You can see in consitional.js file)

Assign grades based on marks using if-else if conditions with range checks.

It also shows how to:

Take user input using prompt().

Use logical operators (&&) for range checking.

Print output using console.log().

Itâ€™s a simple practice of decision-making in JavaScript.
